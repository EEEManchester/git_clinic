# `git_basics`

This repo houses slides from a presentation on `git` and `Github` that was given to members of
the robotics department at the University of Manchester.

As the name suggests, the presentation aimed to give an overview of the very
basics of `git`.

 University of Manchester claims any responsibility for the content of these

## What's in this folder?
### Presentation Slides
TL;DR the slides are in [a pdf](presentation/slides/slides.pdf) which may or may
not be up-to-date.

Included in the presentation folder there are several copies of the slides:

* A Markdown copy
* A html copy
* A pdf copy

The slides were created with Marp. To view the html slides correctly or to update
the pdf it is necessary to install [Marp cli](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli).

If you simply wish to use the slides as a reference the pdf should be
sufficient, although there is no guarantee it is up-to-date (feel free to raise
an issue if needed).

### An annotated bash history from the session
Is in history.txt. It has been tidied up and abridged.
